        <p class="Fact1">First and foremost I am <i>NOT</i> a STEM student and coding 
            is hard. In fact, sometimes all I want is for tech to not be a required part 
            of the curriculum. But I also understand the importance of a wide range
            of interests. Not only do it give me exposure to things I typically wouldn't
            bother with, I could also potentially stumble across something I like. I won't
            say I like coding... but it's enjoyable seeing my work pay off <i>as</i> I'm 
            doing it.</p>

        <a class="Instagram" href="https://www.instagram.com/museum.of.mia/" 
            target= "_blank" data-inline="true"> <button>Instagram</button></a> 
        <a class="Spotify" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/o873fcw998qul3kb2op3lqglz?si=FDruOFzQTG-QGshvVL7yAA" 
            target= "_blank" data-inline="true"> <button>Spotify</button></a>
        <p class="Socialmedia" data-inline="true">The social media platform I predominantly use is Instagram. While it's a private 
            account, I still bothered to link it because why not. I like the concept of 
            "photo-dumps" and just being able to post pictures for myself, other people just
            happen to be able to look at it and comment. I used to take Instagram super 
            seriously and whatnot, but now I don't really care. At this point it's just become
            a personal photo-dump place, another form of entertainment, and a form of 
            communication. </p>
            <p data-inline="true"> The only other "social media" I'd botehr sharing here would be my 
                spotify account. There isn't much to say here. Most of my playlists are private, but 
                I think there are a handful public playlists. Some of those playlists are actually 
                for school events, like the Masquerade and Prom last year, while others are collaborative.
